#To specify the port (when mongodv server is running) to connect when logging in mongodb, use the following command:
mongo --port 27018

#To add document, just start inserting them in json format in the target collection:
db.documents.insertOne({
	"data1", "value1"
	"data2", "value2"
})

#To delete:
db.documents.deleteOne(_id: "txl_lhr-1")

#To delete many:
db.documents.deleteMany(issuer: "Cardif")


#To see the reset of the results after  aquery for example, use the command:
it
#Or toArray() can be added to the end of the command:
db.documents.find().pretty().toarray()

#Other way to filter data and execute an operation over each of the items:
db.documents.find().forEach((docdata) => printjson(docdata))
#In this case it was passed a javascript command inside forEach() method to print to json:
db.documents.find().forEach((docdata) => printjson(docdata))
#Beside printjson, other methods can be found on specific mongo driver (e.g java driver)

# findOne() dows not work with pretty() because it does not provide a cursor

#To delete a db:
db.dropDatabase()

#To delete a collection:
db.myCollection.drop()

#To delete all entries:
db.documents.deleteMany({})

#To check the average size of a given collection:
db.stats()

#Insert many can be done as:
db.answers.insertMany([{_id: "q1a1", text: "It works like this."}, {_id: "q1a2", text: "Thanks!"}])
