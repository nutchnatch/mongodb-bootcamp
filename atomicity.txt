#MongoDB garantees atomic operations where a trasaction succeed as a hole or fail as a hole. If an insert fails, everything is rolled back for this specific document, meaning it is a per-document level (including all embedded documents). This don't work for multiple documents being added at same time. For example, if we use "insertMany" operation, than the success/fail garantees is just provided for each document rather than all documents all together. In this case, if we have an error on "insertMany", just the document where faillure occours is rolled back.
