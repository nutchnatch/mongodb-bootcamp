#Embedded Documents is a way to nest many documents on searching operation
#Mongodb supports up do 100 levels of nesting and each documents must have maximum 16MB of length

#Other way to join documents together is through arrays of embedded documents and this array can hold any data

#To update a document with embedded documents, we can do:
db.documents.updateMany({}, {$set: {data: {confidentialityLevel: "public"}}})
#This will update "data" subdocument with the new info.
